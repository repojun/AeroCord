# AeroCord Theme
A Frugiter Aero Discord Theme.

## ⚠️ This theme breaks every time Discord has a UI update, please be patient for a fix.
## Discord keeps modifying their UI so there's no telling when this theme will and won't work.
## Huge thanks to [Twisty10000](https://github.com/Twisty10000), [ricewind012](https://github.com/ricewind012), [CalvinWieland](https://github.com/CalvinWieland) & [Diode-exe](https://github.com/Diode-exe) for their pull requests as I have been incredibly busy.
